Bash script that helps me practice typing

In attempting to improve my typing speed, I realized there were very few online resources that would help me practice typing in the way I preferred. I wanted to be able to type letter clusters found in very common words, and learn to quickly type numbers and symbols. I also didn't really want to be timed while typing. 

This script is very simple. It just outputs a set of letters/symbols/numbers and then checks to see if the typed response is identical to the prompt.
